                            <span>Powerplex possesses multiple superhuman abilities including enhanced strength,</span>
                            <span>speed, durability, and the ability to generate powerful electrical energy</span>
                            <span>blasts. His powers appear to be augmented by advanced technology</span>
                            <span>integrated into his suit, making him a formidable combatant.</span>

                                <span>Powerplex ranks at #10 because while his abilities make him a genuine threat, skilled heroes</span>
                                <span>can eventually uncover the true source of his strength â€” the energy absorption from his suit.</span>
                                <span>Once they realize that physical attacks only fuel him, his advantage can be neutralized through</span>
                                <span>strategy and restraint rather than brute force. However, Powerplex has proven especially dangerous</span>
                                <span>against heroes who rely on rage, arrogance, or overwhelming force, as their recklessness only</span>
                                <span>feeds his power and plays directly into his hands.</span>

                        <span>Powerplex's origin stems from tragedy - he's driven by a personal</span>
                        <span>vendetta against Invincible after believing the hero was responsible</span>
                        <span>for his family's death during a superhero battle. This grief and rage</span>
                        <span>fuel his relentless pursuit of revenge against the young hero.</span>
